### Day 0: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: started *Introduction to Databases in Python* and completed Basics of Relational Databases.(DataCamp)
I started *Responsive Web Design* and completed Basic HTML and HTML5 (FCCbeta). I also joined a FCC study group

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start now on databases, which i can use for future projects.

**Link to work:** [Introduction to Databases](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python/basics-of-relational-databases?ex=1) <- might not work in a few months.

### Day 1: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed *Basic CSS* from *Responsive Web Design* (FCCbeta) - ahead of schedule, but will go ahead to account for any delays once i get busy with EDSA. I completed *Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries* from DataCamp. looking into creating an instabot and a twitterbot.

**Thoughts**: It's revision for the basic HTML and CSS. the database learning is all new. I found an interesting instagram bot that i will experiment with. I want to create a twitterbot that will periodically give the weather conditions with suggestions on gear to take with.

### Day 2: January 3, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Today i was too drained to do much. nearly finished a chapter on hiarchical tables (DataCamp) and half way through Applied Visual Design (FCCbeta)

**Thoughts**: i tried to get instapy-gui to work at the office but was unsuccessful. i will be installing instapy on the raspi and periodically running it headleass from there.

### Day 4: January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished the Database section on DataCamp. completed half of the Applied Visual Design chapter (FCCbeta). updated and upgraded Raspi then went to bed.

**Thoughts**: ended early at work so didn't finish DB chapter. tomorow i will play with the instapy script.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 5: January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Installed and got the InstaPy script working. tested with the test account. running 100 like on 4 tags for the trail account.  Completed Applied Visual Design (FCCbeta)

**Thoughts**: plan to run the script for the weekend and see if theres uptick.

**Link(s) to work**

 ---
### Day 6: January 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: completed the intro to Databases (DataCamp) and finished chapter1 of Data Viz with Python course. 
Started on Applied Accessibility section (FCCbeta).

**Thoughts**: created a script for my insta account but stopped it in order to test the script with LTC. to see what having a big following and content and then running script does. we hoping to see a nice effect. but after one run i doubt it will be big. Traillurve is already showing noticeable results, but lack of content is stifling growth - i figure.

---
### Day 7: January 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: completedthe Intro to Databases (DataCamp) and just over half way through Data Visualization with Python (DataCamp). I couldn't access FCCbeta to make any progress there.

**Thoughts**: I need to start thinking about the FCC projects and also working out how to complete the CT H2O chart

**Link(s) to work**

---
## Day 8: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Data Visualisation with Python and now working through Intro to Bokeh (DataCamp). for the 2nd day I can't access FCCbeta.

**Thoughts**: I have seen plot.ly, but today i discovered plotly Dash and i think it will make my CT H2O project easier to complete. It's Python base and I can use Pandas. It doesn't look too hard to grasp and hopefully master. I also want to focus on flask so that i can host projects. but for now i think i will put it on the backburner and focus on plotly dash to complete the CT H2O project and see how i can turn the property valuation data into something.

**Link(s) to work** [plotly Dash](#)

---
### Day 9: January 10, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Spent over 4 hours on DataCamp, completing the Data Viz with Bokeh course. I couldn't access FCCbeta again  ;(

**Thoughts**: I learned about Bokeh Server, and free hosting of app on anaconda.org. I see this and Dash are rather difficult to embed in a webpage. 

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 10: January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I spent over four hours on the statistical thinking course pt1 (DataCamp). finally able to access FCCbeta and had to find where i stopped. read up on <u> tag and why not to use it for underlining.

**Thoughts**: I am behind in completing all the DataCamp courses before the academy starts. if i continue at my current rate i might be able to finish by the end of January. Read up more on Bokeh and seems like it is quick and easy to make simple interactive graphs. so will focus on that but continue to learn d3 as that is the King of data viz.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 11: January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: battling a tummy bug but managed to complete intro to stats pt1 (Datacamp).
watched a talk on Bokeh and followed along a tutorial on Bokeh

**Thoughts**: I have decided to focus on Bokeh and eventually to learn d3. Bokeh should be easier to some what master, in terms of quickly generating good visual and interactive graphs.

**Link(s) to work** (Bokeh talk](youtube ang)

---
### Day 12: January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Got up eary and tackled the second part of the Intro to stats (DataCamp). I played around with Bokeh but struggled for some reason to get the first column in the df to pick up in Bokeh. 

**Thoughts**: I will be redoing the data now that i don't have to convert to csv. read it in it excel format and save the df's. then create graphs and link them interactively.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 13: January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I am halfway through the machine learning intro course of DataCamp. I left the final chapter of the stats part2 course on hypothesis testing to be completed tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: in order for me to learn and become proficient in bokeh i will start doing a graph a day building my knowledge on the syntax, especially what i need to load and the capabilities that i can extract.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 14: January 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the stats course and continued with the machine learning intro course. highly enjoyable.

**Thoughts**: very interesting course, i have done a basic ML intro but this covers abit more.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 15: January16 , Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the intro to machine learning and learned alot about the regressors, hyperparameter tuning and piplining. start on the next course which is a practical ML project really.

**Thoughts**: I could skip this current course and move on closer to completing the Data Science track, but this course is very interesting. Also discovered DrivenData and hope to partake in their competitions soon.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 16: January 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: today I was exhausted and struggled to oncentrate on anything today. but the 2nd half of the workday i rallied and worked on the "Machine learning with experts" course until the i couldn't view the video for the next chapter. I then read up on applied accesibility from FCCbeta

**Thoughts**: I've noticed that i really need to eat more the Tuesday night if i do TT or wednesday Blockhouse run. otherwise i am useless the next day.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 17: January 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I still couldn't view the video for the next chapter so researched further Dash. Then read up on barcharts and pi charts on BokehJS. reviewed some work from fellow campers and gave some advice.

**Thoughts**: My last real day at work, took it super easy after i no longer could progress with DataCamp at work. Reviewing others projects has given me motivation to start on my front page projects for FCCbeta

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 18: January 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was my last day at work. worked abit on DataCamp but finishing the last of the admin at work. Did our first trial run of the librarybox in Mosque Shafee after Jumuah. the range is amazing. found a quirk with the latest samsung internet browser.

**Thoughts**: a year later the librarybox is finally installed! luckily i was teamed with not only a good web designer, but someone who will actively monitor and be in charge of it. hopefully this will help many people.

**Link(s) to work** (screenshot)[of the librarybox page]

---
### Day 19: January 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Maching learning with experts course on DataCamp. and half way through the unsupervised learning course.

**Thoughts**: first time looking at unsupervised learning. need to find a project that i can use these algorythms in.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 20: January 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: not much work done today, quite a full day, fkt3.0, a double kids party and another adult party. came home too exhausted.

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 21: January 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: first day of Explore Data Science Academy, alot to take in, and admin... not much coding but 2 sections of statistics, mostly probabilities.

**Thoughts**: tomorrow work begins on python and posgres sql. looking to forward to getting started.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 22: January 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Installed PosgreSQL and spent most of the day doing udemy course on postgreSQL

**Thoughts**: Getting the basic syntax down but the joins are kinda tricky. will need to master that.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 23: January24, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Today was the python installation via Anaconda. created the edsa environment and downloaded necessary libraries. went over the basics of python again at literally double time. I check that jupyter notebook was working correctly, but will only focus on python in three weeks. started on 3rd chapter of unservised learning on DataCamp but switched to the SQL intro

**Thoughts**: Doing the intro of SQL on datacamp was much easier. i guess the second time going over the basics cements the basic concepts firmly. the tables are smaller and easier to navigate which made joining them simpler. finished the intro quite easily before starting on the next SQL course.

**Link(s) to work**

--
### Day 24: January 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today was the final install fest. installed powerBI. i finished half of the advanced SQL course before switching to the powerBI Udemy course. not much could be done today as we had a workshop and were put in groups.

**Thoughts**: DataCamps approach to SQL was much easier to understand than th eUdemy course. they go even further with the joins including anti-join and the tip about using alias when joining tables makes it s much easier. 

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 25: January 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went through half of the powerBI course. end of the first week so abit of social party.

**Thoughts**: from Monday it will be full throttle. i look forward to perfecting my SQL queries and moving on to creating and deleting tables and db's.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day26 : January 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: A pretty chilled day, raspi meetup about sonoff - flashing, demo and possible integration with Home Assistant.

**Thoughts**: I started an openCV course on Udemy for business (1 of only 2 available). i hope to learn enough of the basics to further study CV as well as NLP

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 27: January28 , Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the SQL joining course, left the final 3 problems for tomorrow as a revision. I also started the openCV course. busy with the intro vids, will start soon with the basics.

**Thoughts**: i realise that i have a head start and so should not go at their pace, but perfect what i need to know now, and still continue on openCV and NLP whilst i am ahead and not struggling to keep up.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 28: January 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent 4 hours on "SQL & Database design A-Z" Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: It was super hot 37C and was a struggle to concentrate. will finish the rest of the course tommorrow

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 29: January 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the "SQL & Database design A-Z" Udemy course. very interesting learning about stages of normalisation and thinking about how to go about designing the db around the data we have accumulated. although there is still plenty more that we need.

**Thoughts**:  I am  more confident in SQL queries and will be testing my JOINS tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 30: January 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finish with SQL, finished the SQL and db design course on Udemy.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 31: Febraury 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed _The ultimate SQL Bootcamp_ as well as _SQL: from Zero to Hero_. Played around creating, altering and droppting tables. will make integrating SQL with python much easier now.

**Thoughts**: played around with the water crisis db and it's going to be quite a mission getting it to the 3rd Normalization.
Also the different formatting of the collumns and table, will need a thorough investigationand plan of attack.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 32: Febraury 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today i went over some SQL joins. but spent the bulk of my time searching for database documenatation guidelines and templates,as well as database design philosiphy.

**Thoughts**: After the meeting with our supervisor we were informed of what was expected and the amount of work needed is immense, especially since most of my team members are not up to date with their sql. i will have to take point and write activities that need to be done and each member can decide which ones to complete.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 33: Febraury 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: not much done, read up the intro of _LEARNING_OPENCV_3_COMPUTER_VISION_WITH_PYTHON_ and started with DataCamps NLP intro course learning regex with the re module.

**Thoughts**: Still recovering from yesterdays Batrun recce. went to CTFED.org's workshop on how to give a talk which will be helpfull later when i have to present.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 35: Febraury 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today i learned abit more on PostgreSQL, like the commit, index and copying data from csv into SQL db.

**Thoughts**: my progress is remarkable, but there is still more to learn and then integrating python into it as well. i need the rest of my team to catch up so that we can move forward. till then i will be working on the db documentation.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 36: Febraury 6, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day playing with postgreSQL and a bit of python, using pandas to read in the csv and plot the dam levels for a quick assessment of any discrepencies in the data.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait to start the next phase with python as i am forgetting the basics. so tired of waiting on my team to catch up so we can actually move forward with the db

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 37: Febraury 7, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: as i wait for my colleagues to get up to speed i continued with the documentation.

**Thoughts**: I get that i am a fast learner, but i can see one or two members struggling. helping them out also assists in better understanding of the informtion learned.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 38: Febraury 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: found a book Natural language processing with python. just read the first two chapters

**Thoughts**: all the books are written for python2 and are either being but are not currently for python3. getting the db done is taking too much time

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 39: Febraury 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I am creating views in the db, quite easy and i can see the usefulness.

**Thoughts**: Everyone should be up to date in SQL, but i can see the confidence is lacking.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 42: Febraury 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: completing the SQL test is very challenging. I got 97% which means one wrong answer. i can live with that.

**Thoughts**: I mastered subqueries! after it 'clicked' i started using subqueries for everything instead of so many joins.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 43: Febraury 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: getting could at altering tables and inserting data into the tables.

**Thoughts**: i saw a neat trick of saving interesting queries as views to 'view' later on.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 44: Febraury 14, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up the dam_stats table. using the graphs of the dam height and storage levels of each dam i could find in the data discrepencies and anomolies.

**Thoughts**: I could easily correct the data in pandas but out facilitator says we should be just as adept in SQL to make the necessary changes

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 45: Febraury 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I 3rd normalized a the population table, spliting it into population, population_areas and demographics.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 46: Febraury 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Crunch day for documentation of our database. creating views and adding the wastewater_temp table

**Thoughts**: my SQL queries are good. i should recreate the database and do a proper job of it.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 47: Febraury 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: nothing really progressed. I did create a more accurate Entity Relational Diagram of our Water_crisis database. kids party followed by an after party (somewhat) at my place.

**Thoughts**: one of the few and well deserved rest days. it would of been better had i not been force to pick up the slack

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 48: Febraury 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the database documentation before giving up and handing in the incomplete and substandard team effort.

**Thoughts**: I am really dissapointed in the team relying solely on me and not really caring on what needs to be done, never mind actually doing the work ;(

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 49: Febraury 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today we started the "Analyze" sprint which will focus on Python. went over python basics and Numpy.

**Thoughts**: 
I picked up using lambda functions in map/filter. i used it in javascript but never actually used it in python. i used lambda in the .apply() in Pandas.
**Link(s) to work**
