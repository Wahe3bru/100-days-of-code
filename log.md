# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## R1 2018
### Day 0: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: started *Introduction to Databases in Python* and completed Basics of Relational Databases.(DataCamp)
I started *Responsive Web Design* and completed Basic HTML and HTML5 (FCCbeta). I also joined a FCC study group

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start now on databases, which i can use for future projects.

**Link to work:** [Introduction to Databases](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python/basics-of-relational-databases?ex=1) <- might not work in a few months.


### Day 1: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed *Basic CSS* from *Responsive Web Design* (FCCbeta) - ahead of schedule, but will go ahead to account for any delays once i get busy with EDSA. I completed *Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries* from DataCamp. looking into creating an instabot and a twitterbot.

**Thoughts**: It's revision for the basic HTML and CSS. the database learning is all new. I found an interesting instagram bot that i will experiment with. I want to create a twitterbot that will periodically give the weather conditions with suggestions on gear to take with.

### Day 2: January 3, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Today i was too drained to do much. nearly finished a chapter on hiarchical tables (DataCamp) and half way through Applied Visual Design (FCCbeta)

**Thoughts**: i tried to get instapy-gui to work at the office but was unsuccessful. i will be installing instapy on the raspi and periodically running it headleass from there.

none at the moment


### Day 3: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: none. spent the whole day at Tweede Tol with friends.

### Day 4: January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished the Database section on DataCamp. completed half of the Applied Visual Design chapter (FCCbeta). updated and upgraded Raspi then went to bed.

**Thoughts**: ended early at work so didn't finish DB chapter. tomorow i will play with the instapy script.

### Day 5: January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Installed and got the InstaPy script working. tested with the test account. running 100 like on 4 tags for the trail account.  Completed Applied Visual Design (FCCbeta)

**Thoughts**: plan to run the script for the weekend and see if theres uptick.

### Day 6: January 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: completed the intro to Databases (DataCamp) and finished chapter1 of Data Viz with Python course. 
Started on Applied Accessibility section (FCCbeta).

**Thoughts**: created a script for my insta account but stopped it in order to test the script with LTC. to see what having a big following and content and then running script does. we hoping to see a nice effect. but after one run i doubt it will be big. Traillurve is already showing noticeable results, but lack of content is stifling growth - i figure.

### Day 7: January 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: completedthe Intro to Databases (DataCamp) and just over half way through Data Visualization with Python (DataCamp). I couldn't access FCCbeta to make any progress there.

**Thoughts**: I need to start thinking about the FCC projects and also working out how to complete the CT H2O chart

## Day 8: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Data Visualisation with Python and now working through Intro to Bokeh (DataCamp). for the 2nd day I can't access FCCbeta.

**Thoughts**: I have seen plot.ly, but today i discovered plotly Dash and i think it will make my CT H2O project easier to complete. It's Python base and I can use Pandas. It doesn't look too hard to grasp and hopefully master. I also want to focus on flask so that i can host projects. but for now i think i will put it on the backburner and focus on plotly dash to complete the CT H2O project and see how i can turn the property valuation data into something.

### Day 9: January 10, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Spent over 4 hours on DataCamp, completing the Data Viz with Bokeh course. I couldn't access FCCbeta again  ;(

**Thoughts**: I learned about Bokeh Server, and free hosting of app on anaconda.org. I see this and Dash are rather difficult to embed in a webpage.

### Day 10: January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I spent over four hours on the statistical thinking course pt1 (DataCamp). finally able to access FCCbeta and had to find where i stopped. read up on <u> tag and why not to use it for underlining.

**Thoughts**: I am behind in completing all the DataCamp courses before the academy starts. if i continue at my current rate i might be able to finish by the end of January. Read up more on Bokeh and seems like it is quick and easy to make simple interactive graphs. so will focus on that but continue to learn d3 as that is the King of data viz.

### Day 11: January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: battling a tummy bug but managed to complete intro to stats pt1 (Datacamp).
watched a talk on Bokeh and followed along a tutorial on Bokeh

**Thoughts**: I have decided to focus on Bokeh and eventually to learn d3. Bokeh should be easier to some what master, in terms of quickly generating good visual and interactive graphs.

### Day 12: January 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Got up eary and tackled the second part of the Intro to stats (DataCamp). I played around with Bokeh but struggled for some reason to get the first column in the df to pick up in Bokeh. 

**Thoughts**: I will be redoing the data now that i don't have to convert to csv. read it in it excel format and save the df's. then create graphs and link them interactively.

### Day 13: January 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I am halfway through the machine learning intro course of DataCamp. I left the final chapter of the stats part2 course on hypothesis testing to be completed tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: in order for me to learn and become proficient in bokeh i will start doing a graph a day building my knowledge on the syntax, especially what i need to load and the capabilities that i can extract.

### Day 14: January 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the stats course and continued with the machine learning intro course. highly enjoyable.

**Thoughts**: very interesting course, i have done a basic ML intro but this covers abit more.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 15: January16 , Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the intro to machine learning and learned alot about the regressors, hyperparameter tuning and piplining. start on the next course which is a practical ML project really.

**Thoughts**: I could skip this current course and move on closer to completing the Data Science track, but this course is very interesting. Also discovered DrivenData and hope to partake in their competitions soon.

### Day 16: January 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: today I was exhausted and struggled to oncentrate on anything today. but the 2nd half of the workday i rallied and worked on the "Machine learning with experts" course until the i couldn't view the video for the next chapter. I then read up on applied accesibility from FCCbeta

**Thoughts**: I've noticed that i really need to eat more the Tuesday night if i do TT or wednesday Blockhouse run. otherwise i am useless the next day.

### Day 18: January 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I still couldn't view the video for the next chapter so researched further Dash. Then read up on barcharts and pi charts on BokehJS. reviewed some work from fellow campers and gave some advice.

**Thoughts**: My last real day at work, took it super easy after i no longer could progress with DataCamp at work. Reviewing others projects has given me motivation to start on my front page projects for FCCbeta

### Day 19: January 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was my last day at work. worked abit on DataCamp but finishing the last of the admin at work. Did our first trial run of the librarybox in Mosque Shafee after Jumuah. the range is amazing. found a quirk with the latest samsung internet browser.

**Thoughts**: a year later the librarybox is finally installed! luckily i was teamed with not only a good web designer, but someone who will actively monitor and be in charge of it. hopefully this will help many people.

### Day 20: January 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Maching learning with experts course on DataCamp. and half way through the unsupervised learning course.

**Thoughts**: first time looking at unsupervised learning. need to find a project that i can use these algorythms in.
