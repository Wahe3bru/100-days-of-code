# 100 Days Of Code - Log

####R1 2018
### Day 0: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: started *Introduction to Databases in Python* and completed Basics of Relational Databases.(DataCamp)
I started *Responsive Web Design* and completed Basic HTML and HTML5 (FCCbeta). I also joined a FCC study group

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start now on databases, which i can use for future projects.

**Link to work:** [Introduction to Databases](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python/basics-of-relational-databases?ex=1) <- might not work in a few months.


### Day 1: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed *Basic CSS* from *Responsive Web Design* (FCCbeta) - ahead of schedule, but will go ahead to account for any delays once i get busy with EDSA. I completed *Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries* from DataCamp. looking into creating an instabot and a twitterbot.

**Thoughts**: It's revision for the basic HTML and CSS. the database learning is all new. I found an interesting instagram bot that i will experiment with. I want to create a twitterbot that will periodically give the weather conditions with suggestions on gear to take with.

### Day 2: January 3, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Today i was too drained to do much. nearly finished a chapter on hiarchical tables (DataCamp) and half way through Applied Visual Design (FCCbeta)

**Thoughts**: i tried to get instapy-gui to work at the office but was unsuccessful. i will be installing instapy on the raspi and periodically running it headleass from there.
