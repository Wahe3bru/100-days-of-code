### Day 16: May 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the RegEx section of Colt. Completed the Linear Classifiers in Python course in DataCamp

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow  I will put my knew regex knowlede to preprocess the  mbti text dataset.

### Day 17: May 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I wrote all the individual functions for creating each feature in the dataset, then combined them all in a single function. regex really usefull.

**Thoughts**: I found a great blog that had regex exercises. will include them in my summary to drill the concepts into memmory
