**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 18: May 12, Saturday

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 20: May 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: went over Dash layout, html and core components. Created my own stopwords list for the Personality profile sprint. and started thinking about pipelines and working out a strategy.

**Thoughts**: Dash is very interesting. will look into hosting the server on raspi, as well as finding a great project to practive what i have learned.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 21: May 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Did the baseline result using countvectorizer and multinomialNB. played with a few parameters and results were dismal. Researched FeatureUnion, functionTransformer to join my created features along with countvectorizer to train the model.

**Thoughts**: I am probably going well above what's expected but learning about featureUnion is helpful in expanding my knowledge.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 22: May 16, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: I built functions to get numerical and text data used functionTransformer to be able to use them in a pipeline. built text and numerical pipeline and merged them with FeatureUnion into main pipeline

**Thoughts**: after successfully creating main pipeline, had errors with the text part after creating y_labels (therefore creating binary labels)

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 23: May 17, Thursday (Fasting starts)

**Today's Progress**: struggled half the day trying to solve the main pipeline issue. gave up after mega headache.

**Thoughts**: starting over, concentrating on just nlp for the model. then include numerical features.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 24: May 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: not feeling very well, went over Dash and started a new course on algorithms and interview questions

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 25: May 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: went over Dash, built an interactive display using a range slider and outputting to a div.

**Thoughts**: I'm thinking of reviving the dc enviro project using dash instead of highcharts. I'm using flask anyway.

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 26: May 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: got a working model using Random Forest. basic settings, need to do gridsearch on hyperparameters.

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**

---
### Day 27: May 21, Monday

**Thoughts**: 

---
### Day 40: June 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started another DL course 'Deep Learning A-Z' on Udemy, went through the first chapter. 

**Thoughts**: Using Keras is SO much simpler that TF. I think learning and aplying Keras will be better to get started using DL, and then learn TF proper in case i need to go deeper.

---
### Day 41: June 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Forward feed NN chapter from DL A-Z, learned to crossval and gridsearch using the keraswrapper and scikit-learn.

**Thoughts**: I need to find a few basic datasets to test my usage of coding a NN. maybe from the datasets used in ML A-Z course.

---
### Day 42: June 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Gone over Decision Trees and Random Forest from ML A-Z.

**Thoughts**: Reading an article on embedding ML in a webapp i came across batching huge data and training the model sequntially using `.partial_fit()`. waiting on the next article where the writer uses flask to run the webapp.

---
### Day 43: June 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I spent most of the day reviewing kaggle kernels on predicting games.

**Thoughts**: 

---
### Day 44: June 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Built a basic model to predict results. Then refactored it into a function.

**Thoughts**: Now that I have a basic model, I can build one with more vairables and hopefully more accurate.

---
### Day 45: June 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: terrible migraine. not much work done
